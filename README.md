## 🌟 Why This Repository Exists

Most Vision Transformer tutorials rely on **pre-built or pretrained models**.  
This repository is built for:

- 🎓 Students  
- 👨‍💻 Developers  
- 🔬 Researchers  

who want to **build Vision Transformers from scratch** and truly understand:

- Patch Embeddings  
- Self-Attention  
- CLS Token  
- Transformer Encoder Blocks  

---

##  Core Concepts Explained

### 🧩 Patch Embedding
Images are split into fixed-size patches and projected into embeddings.  
This replaces convolutions with pure tokenization.

### 🔍 Self-Attention
Each patch attends to every other patch, enabling **global image understanding** — not just local features.

### 🎯 CLS Token
A learnable token that aggregates information from all patches and performs classification.

###  Transformer Encoder
LayerNorm, residual connections, attention, and MLP blocks stacked to build **deep vision models**.
